# Install PxWeb 2 on your IIS server

This instruction guides you in how to install PxWeb 2 on IIS.

## Prerequisites

- A supported Windows server with IIS installed.
- The [URL Rewrite module](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) must be installed on your IIS.
- ApiUrl to your PxWebApi 2 installation.
  If your tables endpoint is at `https://your.api.server/PxWeb/api/v2/tables`
  then your ApiUrl is `https://your.api.server/PxWeb/api/v2`  (omit a trailing slash, one is added automatically)

## Installation steps

1. Download the [zip file for the latest release](https://github.com/pxtools/PxWeb2/releases/latest) from GitHub.
  It is found inside the Asserts heading.
  Make sure to _Unblock_ it if its block by right clicking on it in _File Explorer_ and check the `Unblock` checkbox.
2. Put the contents of the zip file to the location of your choice. E.g `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\pxweb2`.
3. Adjust `baseApplicationPath` and `apiUrl` in `config\config.js`:

    ```js
    baseApplicationPath: "/pxweb2/"
        
    apiUrl: "your api url"
    ```

4. In `index.html`, adjust the `<base>` tag:

    ```html
    <base href="/pxweb2/">
    ```

5. In `web.config`, adjust the `Content-Security-Policy` to allow calls to your PxWebApi 2 installation. Within the `Content-Security-Policy` replace the text `https://enter-your-api-domain-here` with the domain of your PxWebApi (for example https://api.scb.se):

    ```html
    <add name="Content-Security-Policy" value="default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://api.scb.se; script-src 'self'" />
    ```

1. In IIS find the folder and convert it to application. (Consider using a separate Application pool for this)

1. Open "http(s)://"server adress"/pxweb2 .

## Troubleshooting

### Problem running PxWeb on localhost

If you are trying to run PxWeb directly on the server under localhost you might get an error looking like this in the console of your browser:

  ```
  Uncaught EvalError: Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'".
  ```

#### Solution

Change localhost in the URL to the computer name of the server.

### PxWeb refuses to connect to PxWebApi

If you get an error message looking like this in the console of your browser:

  ```
  Refused to connect to 'https://your-api-url' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://enter-your-api-domain-here".
  ```

#### Solution

You need to enter the domain of your PxWebApi in the Content Security Policy section in web.config, see step 5 of the installation steps above.
