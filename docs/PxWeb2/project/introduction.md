# What is PxWeb? 
PxWeb is an open-source software for publishing and browsing statistical tables online, developed by Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway. 
You can customize PxWeb so it match your organisation’s visual profile, including colours, fonts, logo and icons. 

Its popularity comes from being:
- open-source, no license fees
- WCAG compliant
- lightweight, high performance
- mobile friendly
- designed specifically for statistics published by national statistical offices and other government agencies

## PxWeb offers
### 1. A user centric approach to dissemination of statistics
PxWeb is developed with user needs at the forefront. We care about the professionals who uses PxWeb for work, but also more casual users who need statistics to make informed decisions in their daily lives. 
### 2.  A multidimensional Table Engine
PxWeb handles datasets with many variables (e.g., year × region × sex). Users can:
- Select which variables to include
- Filter or pivot data
- Generate a custom table
### 3. A built-in API 
Every dataset published in PXWeb automatically gets an API endpoint, allowing:
- developers to access data programmatically
- reproducible reporting
- integration with R, Python, Power BI, etc.
### 4. Standardised Table Format (Px/Axes)
PxWeb uses the px-file format, designed for statistical tables with:
- consistent metadata
- classifications
- variable hierarchies
- units, footnotes and descriptions
### 5. Multilingual Support
Interfaces and metadata can be translated easily which is important for organisations serving multiple language groups.
### 6. Easy maintenance
Users can update datasets by:
- replacing px-files
- automating updates via scripts
- integrating PxWeb with internal production systems
### 7. Open-source complimentary applications
To facilitate the use of PxWeb, several organisations have developed complimentary open source Px-tools: 
- For browsing and editing px-files (PxWin)
- For producing px-files (PxEdit and PxJob)
- For graphs and figures (PxGraph – requires a Highcharts lisence)
