# Configuring PxWebApi 2.0
The configuration is split into several different files, each with a specific purpose. The main file you will need to modify is `appsettings.json`.

## appsettings.json
This file contains all functional settings. A recommended configuration after installation is the Admin protection settings, which control access to the admin API. The settings in `appsettings.json` can also be overridden by environment variables. For example, to set the DataSourceType, define an environment variable called `DataSource__DataSourceType`.

### General settings

#### Language
Specify which languages should be available by editing the `PxApiConfiguration.Languages` section. Set the default language by assigning `PxApiConfiguration.DefaultLanguage` to the `id` of one of the languages listed under `PxApiConfiguration.Languages`.

#### Downloading data
You can limit the size of data that can be downloaded using the `PxApiConfiguration.MaxDataCells` setting.
You can also control which formats are available for downloading data by setting `PxApiConfiguration.OutputFormats`.
The following formats can be enabled or disabled:

- Excel (`xlsx`)
- HTML table (`html`)
- Legacy PxJson format (`json-px`)
- Parquet (`parquet`)

The following formats are always available and cannot be disabled:

- PX (`px`)
- JSON-stat v2 (`json-stat2`)
- Comma separated (`csv`)

!!! note
    JSON-stat v1 has been deprecated and is no longer supported as an output format.

#### Attribution
You can specify how you would like others to reference your data by setting `PxApiConfiguration.SourceReference`. Make sure to provide a section for each language specified under `PxApiConfiguration.Languages`.

You can also specify the license for the data under `PxApiConfiguration.License`.

#### Caching
You can control how long a response should be cached by setting `PxApiConfiguration.CacheTime` (in seconds).

You also have the option to clear the cache at a specific time by setting `PxApiConfiguration.CacheClearTime`.

### Datasource
PxWebApi 2.0 supports two different data sources: PX file-based or CNMM. You can only configure one at a time. Set `DataSource.DataSourceType` to either `PX` or `CNMM` to specify which you want to use.

#### PX datasource
For the PX file datasource, you can set `DataSource.DataSourceType.PX.StrictAggregations` to either `true` or `false` to determine if aggregations can be overlapping or not.

#### CNMM datasource
You should only have one database specified, and you must set `DataSource.DataSourceType.CNMM.DatabaseId` to match the `id` of the database in `SqlDb.config`.

When you configure the CNMM datasource, a health check is automatically set up to verify the database connection. It connects to the default database in `SqlDb.config` and executes a statement. The default statement is `select 1`, but you can change this by setting `DataSource.DataSourceType.CNMM.HealthCheckQuery`. Avoid using queries that take a long time to process.

### Saved query storage
Saved queries are an essential part of the API. Users can create, view, and run saved queries. Saved queries can also be used as the default selection when a user does not specify any selection when downloading data.

You can store saved queries either as files on the file system or in a relational database. Select the storage method by setting `SavedQuery.Backend`.

#### File
Specify the path where saved queries should be stored by setting `SavedQuery.FileStorage.Path`.

#### Database
Specify the connection string and other relevant settings for storing saved queries in a database.

### Rate limiting
API rate limiting settings are found under `IpRateLimiting`. You can read more about the options [here](https://github.com/stefanprodan/aspnetcoreratelimit/wiki/ipratelimitmiddleware). The most important settings are `IpRateLimiting.GeneralRules.Period` and `IpRateLimiting.GeneralRules.Limit`, which control the time window and the number of calls allowed during that period.
If you do not run behind a proxy or load balancer, you should remove the `IpRateLimiting.RealIpHeader` setting.


### Admin protection
The admin API is protected by both an IP filter and a token that must be specified in the request. You can set these options using `AdminProtection.IpWhitelist` and `AdminProtection.AdminKey`. You can specify more than one IP in `AdminProtection.IpWhitelist`, including ranges of IPs in CIDR notation.


## app.config
This is for legacy configuration. It contains paths for:
- language files
- aggregation and valueset files
- the name of the CNMM configuration file
In most cases, the default settings are sufficient and you do not need to modify this file.

## web.config
The `web.config` file is used to configure PxWebApi 2.0 when running on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). In most cases, the default settings are sufficient and you do not need to modify this file. Only advanced scenarios or specific server requirements may require changes.

## SqlDb.config
Currently, this file is the same as in PxWeb 2023, with one exception: you should only have one database specified.

## log4net.config
The `log4net.config` file manages how PxWebApi 2.0 creates and stores logs. By default, logs are saved in the `/logs` directory. PxWebApi 2.0 relies on log4net for logging, which allows you to customize log levels, formats, and destinations. For more information on how to configure log4net, please refer to the official documentation [here](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/manual/configuration.html).
